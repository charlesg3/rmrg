# ICS 300

## Questions Missed on Pre-test
- Unified Command organization: shares facilities and coordinates a process for resource
- Before establishing strategies or executing tactics, what must be developed? Incident Objectives
- In what meeting are the proposed incident strategies and tactics developed by
  the Operations Section? Tactics meeting
- During what meeting is the final opportunity to validate the Operational Plan
  and resources as proposed by the Operations Section Chief? Planning meeting
- What is the purpose of the Operations Briefing? present IAP to supervisors of tactical resources.
- When ordering resources, what type of ordering places a heavier load on
  incident personnel by requiring them to place orders through two or more
  ordering points? Multipoint Ordering
- With whom or what should the Incident Commander consult when demobilizing
  resources to ensure proper release? Agency Protocols
-

## Review
- Common incident facilities and locations
- Unity of Command - 1 boss
- Integrated Communications -
- Unified Command - 

---

### Staff

Command Staff - PIO Safety and Liason

General Staff - Ops Planning Logistics and Finance

FLOP - Finance Logistics Operations and Planning

![](org.png)

- Branches -- Numbered (roman numerals)
- Divisions -- Geographic (think Div ABCD from Fire)
- Groups are Functional
- Strike Team -- all the same
- Task Force -- bunch of different resources (each may have boss)

- Everything under operations is a "tactical" operation

![](planningp.png)


EOC -- coordination role
IC -- "command" role

---

### Planning

*Incident* - unexpected occurrence that requires immediate response

*Event* - A scheduled non-emergency activity (e.g. sporting event)


Lifesafety - get people out

Stabilization - up hill up wind up stream, contain hazard

Property preservation - keep river clear, set up perimeter

### Implementing Operational Planning Process

ICS Form 215 - Operational Planning Worksheet

ICS Form 215A - IAP Safety Analysis

### Planning Process, IAP and Operations Briefs

Planning meeting: lead by planning section chief, attended by command + general staff (other incident management personnel, agency admin, cooperating/assisting agency personnel)

Review and validate ops plan, identify resource req's

# Final Notes

1. roles and reporting relationships
2. incident objectives
3. ics 215 operational planning worksheet

NIMS components: command and coordination
- ics
- eoc
- multiagency coordination group

Chain of Command

ics 
- command staff (pio / liason safety)
- general staff - flop

Incident Management Roles
- ICS
- senior officials
- joint information system
- eoc director

Authority / Mission & Strategid Direction

Modular expansion - develop organizational structure to function or task to be performed

Unified Command Features - one set of incident objectives, single planning process and IAP

Multiagency unified command:
- local / state / federal

Complex incidents: communications and information may be incomplete
- time is of the essence
- situation is unstable
- can expand rapidly

Planning for Events -- use ICS and IAP

Complexity analysis factors -- community and responder safety

Policies and guidelines -- continuity of operations plans

Objectives, Strategies and Tactics -- specify how the strategies will be executed

Steps in Transfer of Command - Deliver briefing ICS 201

Cost-benefit analysis -- factors in addressing costs, key things is safety (make sure conservative)

The Tactics Meeting -- looking a proposed strategies and tactics developed by operations section chief

Communicate decision made in Tactics Meeting concerning resources assignments to Resource Unit (ICS 215) -- part of the planning section

ICS Form 215A - Incident Action Plan Safety Analysis, completed by Safety Officer and Operations Section Chief to determine work assignments can be complete safely

The Planning Meeting -- Review and validate the Operational Plan; identify resource requirements
- attended by command / general staff, other personnel, admin, cooperating agency

ICS Form 202, Incident Objectives

Operations Briefing - Presenting the IAP to supervisors of tactical resources

Resource Management -- orderly, safe and efficient return of resources

Authority to Order Resources -- The IC, LSC, SPUL (supply unit leader) and ordering manager are authorized to place orders for resources

Multipoint Ordering -- ordering from multiple different places

Incident Management Team -- Rostered group of ICS qualified personnel, (IC, other incident leadership, other ICS positions)

Resource Performance Evaluation - evaluated on an ongoing basis throughout incident

Poor performance -- Unrealistic incident objectives, strategies or tactics

Demobilize -- resources are rehabilitated, replenished and/or returned

Agency Policies and Procedures -- Work rules / Agency Policies might affect demob plan (e.g. hours they can work)

Liason Officer has information about agreements other agency resources

Demob Plan Sections -- 5 sections -- Travel Information

Transfer of Command in Stabilizing / De-escalating incidents -- when incident stabilized might need to transfer of command

Conducing an After-Action Review -- what happened, why, lessons learned, follow up

*Incident* - unexpected occurrence that requires immediate response

*Event* - A scheduled non-emergency activity (e.g. sporting event)


Lifesafety - get people out

Stabilization - up hill up wind up stream, contain hazard

Property preservation - keep river clear, set up perimeter

### Implementing Operational Planning Process

ICS Form 215 - Operational Planning Worksheet

ICS Form 215A - IAP Safety Analysis

### Planning Process, IAP and Operations Briefs

Planning meeting: lead by planning section chief, attended by command + general staff (other incident management personnel, agency admin, cooperating/assisting agency personnel)

Review and validate ops plan, identify resource req's
